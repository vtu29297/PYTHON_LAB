Task 1: Running Python Script and various expressions in an interactive interpreter

Aim:
 		To run python Script and various expressions in an interactive interpreter 

a.	Create a python program to enter two numbers and then performs and displays the results of the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Algorithm:
1.Start.
2.Get the two numbers and store it in variable x and y.
3.For Addition do ; x+y and print it.
4.For Subtraction do ; x-y and print it.
5.For Multiplication do ; x*y and print it.
6.For Division do; x/y and print it.
7.Stop

Program:
x =int(input("Enter the First number:"))
y =int(input("Enter the Second number:"))
  
add = x + y 
sub = x - y 
pro = x * y 
div = x / y 
  
print("Addition:",add) 
print("Subtraction :",sub) 
print("Multiplication:",pro) 
print("Division:",div)

b.	Create a python program to enter two numbers and then performs and displays the results of the following relational expression : >, <, ==, !=, >=, <=

Algorithm:
1.Start
2.Get the the input from the user and store it in a,b&c.
3.Perform the relational operations( i.e, >,<.=,==,!=,>=,<=).
4.Print the results.
5.Stop.

Program:

# Initializing the value of a, b, and c
a = int(input("Enter the First number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the Second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter the Third number: "))

# Using relational operators
print(a, ">", b, "is", a > b)
print(a, "<", b, "is", a < b)
print(c, "==", a, "is", c == a)
print(c, "!=", b, "is", c != b)
print(a, ">=", b, "is", a >= b)
print(b, "<=", a, "is", b <= a)

c.	Create a python program to enter three numbers and then performs and displays the results of the following Logical operations: and, or, not.

Algorithm:
1.Start.
2.Get the input from the user.
3.Perform the logical operations on the inputs.
4.Print the results.
5.Stop.

Program:
# Taking three numbers as input
a = int(input("Enter the First number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the Second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter the Third number: "))

# Performing logical operations
print("\nLogical Operations Results:")
print((a > b) and (b > c))
print((a > b) or (b > c))
print(not(a > b))
print(not(b > c))

Output


 




Result
      Thus, the python program to run Python Script and various expressions in an interactive interpreter was don successfully and the output was verified.
